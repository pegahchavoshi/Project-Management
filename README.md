# Scheduling and Sensitivity Analysis of Models for MedCON



# Introduction

The Nightingale project aims to develop a handheld electronic medical reference guide for emergency medical technicians and paramedics. The goal is to produce 30 working models in time for MedCON, the biggest medical equipment trade show, by October 25. 


# Project Objective

These questions will be addressed upon completion of the project schedule using MS Project modeling and scheduling techniques:

1. Will the project be completed by the planned deadline of October 25th?

3. Which activities are critical to the project's success and lie on the critical path?
 
4. How sensitive is the project network to potential delays or changes in the critical path activities?

# Results

1. Based on the results of the project schedule analysis, it is apparent that there will be a considerable delay in completing the Nightingale Project and will not meet the intended deadline of October 25th, 2017. This delay will likely have a significant impact on the project's success, given the competitive landscape and the importance of meeting the MedCON deadline. It is clear that most of the project activities will take longer to complete than originally planned, which will impact the critical path and the overall project schedule.

To address this delay, the project team may need to consider implementing strategies to accelerate certain activities and streamline the project schedule. Additionally, the team should closely monitor the critical path activities and prioritize those that are most critical to the project's success. Any potential delays or risks should be proactively managed to avoid further delays or disruptions to the project timeline.

Overall, it is crucial for the project team to remain vigilant in their efforts to complete the Nightingale Project within a reasonable timeframe. The success of the project will depend on their ability to manage the project effectively and efficiently, despite the considerable challenges posed by the delay.


2. Upon analyzing the project schedule, it is evident that there are several activities critical to the success of the Nightingale Project. These activities are those that lie on the critical path and are therefore the most time-sensitive.

The critical path activities include:

1.Architectural decisions

2.Feature specifications

3.Database

4.Review design

5.Integration

6.Procure prototype components

7.Assemble prototypes

8.Lab test prototypes

9.Field test prototypes

10.Adjust design

11.Order stock parts

12.Assemble first production unit

13.Test unit

14.Produce 30 units

15.Train sales representatives

It is important that the project team carefully manages and monitors these critical path activities to ensure that they are completed on time and within budget. Any delays in these activities could have a significant impact on the overall project timeline and success. The team should prioritize these activities and allocate appropriate resources to ensure that they are completed on schedule.


3. The concept of sensitivity pertains to the degree to which the critical path may change as the project unfolds. A highly sensitive network is characterized by having multiple critical paths and/or non-critical activities with minimal slack, increasing the likelihood of changes to the original critical path as work begins.

 Based on my analysis, I believe that this network is not highly sensitive because roughly half of the tasks are critical, while the other half possess significant slack. Although most of these non-critical activities are likely to exceed their estimated duration times, they each have ample slack ranging from 20 to 37 days, except for "price component" with 5 days of slack and "order custom part" with 8 days of slack. However, given the nature of these activities, it is improbable that they would require more than 5 days beyond their estimated duration to complete. Additionally, only two non-critical activities, "document design" and "order custom parts," exist during the second half of the project after the initial burst of activities. Consequently, while a highly sensitive project would have multiple critical paths, this project only has one, indicating low sensitivity.
