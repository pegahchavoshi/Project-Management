# Project-Management
Schedualing the Project using MS Project



# Introduction

The Nightingale project aims to develop a handheld electronic medical reference guide for emergency medical technicians and paramedics. The goal is to produce 30 working models in time for MedCON, the biggest medical equipment trade show, by October 25. 


# Project Objective

These questions will be addressed upon completion of the project schedule using MS Project modeling and scheduling techniques:

1. Will the project be completed by the planned deadline of October 25th?

3. Which activities are critical to the project's success and lie on the critical path?
 
4. How sensitive is the project network to potential delays or changes in the critical path activities?

# Results

1. Based on the results of the project schedule analysis, it is apparent that there will be a considerable delay in completing the Nightingale Project and will not meet the intended deadline of October 25th, 2017. This delay will likely have a significant impact on the project's success, given the competitive landscape and the importance of meeting the MedCON deadline. It is clear that most of the project activities will take longer to complete than originally planned, which will impact the critical path and the overall project schedule.

To address this delay, the project team may need to consider implementing strategies to accelerate certain activities and streamline the project schedule. Additionally, the team should closely monitor the critical path activities and prioritize those that are most critical to the project's success. Any potential delays or risks should be proactively managed to avoid further delays or disruptions to the project timeline.

Overall, it is crucial for the project team to remain vigilant in their efforts to complete the Nightingale Project within a reasonable timeframe. The success of the project will depend on their ability to manage the project effectively and efficiently, despite the considerable challenges posed by the delay.
