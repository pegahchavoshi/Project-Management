Schedualing the Project using MS Project



# Introduction

The Nightingale project aims to develop a handheld electronic medical reference guide for emergency medical technicians and paramedics. The goal is to produce 30 working models in time for MedCON, the biggest medical equipment trade show, by October 25. 


# Project Objective

These questions will be addressed upon completion of the project schedule using MS Project modeling and scheduling techniques:

Will the project be completed by the planned deadline of October 25th?
Which activities are critical to the project's success and lie on the critical path?
How sensitive is the project network to potential delays or changes in the critical path activities?
